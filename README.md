# RideSharingSystem
This Java program simulates a simple ride-sharing fare calculation system for two types of vehicles: Bike and Car. It allows users to input the type of ride and the travel distance, and then calculates the fare based on predefined per-kilometer rates
-Bike: â‚¹10 per kilometer
-Car: â‚¹20 per kilometer

The system also handles invalid ride types and distances through custom and standard exception handling.

# ðŸ§¾Features

-Object-Oriented Design using abstract classes and inheritance.
-Polymorphic behavior for different ride types (BikeRide and CarRide).
-Custom exception handling for invalid ride types (InvalidRideTypeException).
-Input validation for distance values.
-Dynamic fare calculation based on ride type and distance.

# How to Use
--bash
git clone https://github.com/<saicharan-git01>/RideSharingSystem
javac RideSharingSystem.java
java RideSharingSystem

NOTE:
The driver names and vehicle numbers are hardcoded for simplicity.
You can easily extend the system to support more ride types or dynamic pricing.
